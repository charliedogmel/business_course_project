3: Shows steady to moderate growth in residential and community solar
4: However, growth was highly underpredicted in 2002 (red), 2010 (pink), 2012 (lt. blue), and 2015 (although here prediction is getting better finally)
5: At the same time, 1 in 3 U.S. households experience energy insecurity; they spend a disproportionate amount of income on utilities at 8.5%. Adopting solar can lower monthly utility bills, but many primarily lower-income households rent, live in multi-tenant buildings, have unsuitable roofs, or just can't afford a solar PV installation.

Slide 6:
Energy for All already addresses this by partnering with utilities and community groups to develop community shared solar arrays to benefit those households.
I propose to use machine learning to more effectively reach even more low-income and underserved households.

The success metrics will be ...

Slide 8:
Project Sunroof uses Google Maps satellite images to estimate the solar potential of rooftops of each census tract. It also creates a list of each rooftops solar panel capacity.
DeepSolar used the same imaging to identify the rooftops with existing solar PV systems; this is the first comprehensive list of existing solar installations.
Use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to group clusters of census tracts that are alike with features that influence solar adoption. Find the cluster with the highest existing solar systems.
